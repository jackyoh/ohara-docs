Ohara is open to users, developers and man living in earth. Hence, we prepare a bunch of 
docs to help you to understand ohara comprehensively but quickly.

## For User

This section is for the ohara users who are going to install and then test official streaming application. For this case,
you don't need to compile, build or write anything for ohara. All you have to read the [user guide]({{< relref "user_guide.md" >}})
and then follow the advice of [installation section]({{< relref "user_guide.md#installation" >}}).

We now provide a quickstart VM for you to quickly start Ohara and play with it in a single VM. 
You can learn more from [Using Quickstart VM]({{< relref "quickstart/quickstartvm.md" >}})

## For Developer

If you want to know how to build ohara, please read: [How to build Ohara]({{< relref "build/build-ohara.md" >}})

Apart from contributing code to ohara, you can also leverage ohara to design your
[custom connector]({{< relref "custom_connector.md" >}}), [custom stream]({{< relref "custom_stream.md" >}})
or build your UI interface via [Ohara REST interface]({{< relref "rest-api/" >}}).
